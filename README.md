# Update [14/08/2025]
Greetings! I have not had time to update this guide since the new NixOS release; Though, everything should still work the same way.
Nevertheless, as you may be able to see from the screenshot below, a BIG upgrade is coming to this guide at some point.

# Update [13/02/2026]
Well, there are way better options to install NixOS alongside an existing Windows installation, it was a bit silly of me to try to do it this way. Furthermore, some people had already written similar if not better guides! As such, this repository will be archived.

However, I have not been able to work on it since June. I hope to have more free time to work on it again sooner than later, so, please bare with me and the old guide for a little while longer!
